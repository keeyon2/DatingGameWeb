1. Your games will eventually be placed at [Dr Ecco web site](http://cims.nyu.edu/drecco/index.php?task=homepage "Dr Ecco web site")
2. Use HTML5, Javascript
2. Contain your game HTML elements to a "div" tag as shown:
<code>
&lt;div id="gameArea"&gt;
...
&lt;/div&gt;
</code>
3. Do not use applets and embedded objects (as you might have seen these eventually become unusable because of the numerous dependencies on OS, web browser, plug-in security and hot fixes and such)
4. We recommend that you pick a game for the final project, before Nov 19, 2015
5. Note that these games are for person-to-computer play or person-to-person play. So the game parameters and the game tactics could change (as to what constitutes a move, placing a move, game timeouts and so on) from the weekly games we play.
6. It is important that you maintain a score for the winner and the loser, since these would eventually make it into a leaderboard for your game
7. The leaderboards are maintained within Dr Ecco site and not a part of the game, and there will need to be interfaces (Javascript variables/globals that will need to be made visible to the site)
8. More details to follow soon
