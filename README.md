1. Use HTML5, Javascript
2. Contain your game HTML elements to a "div" tag as shown:
<code>
&lt;div id="gameArea"&gt;
...
&lt;/div&gt;
</code>

3. Do not use applets and embedded objects (as you might have seen these eventually become unusable because of the numerous dependencies on OS, web browser, plug-in security and hot fixes and such)
4. We recommend that you pick a game for the final project, before next week
5. Note that these games are for person-to-computer play or person-to-person play. So the game parameters and the game tactics could change (as to what constitutes a move and game timeouts and so on).
6. It is important that you maintain a score for the winner and if lost by how many as well, since these would eventually make it into a leaderboard for your game
7. The leaderboards are maintained within Dr Ecco site and not a part of the game, and there will need to be interfaces (Javascript variables/globals that will need to be made visible to the site)
